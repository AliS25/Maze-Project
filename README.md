# Maze-Project
A set of three maze puzzles is displayed in a GUI where the user tries to go from the start to the goal. Once the program is started, a menu displays random buttons from the three mazes, and a game menu button allows the user to select one of the three mazes. Each maze has a different set of rules and its name. Each maze provides a short description describing how it should be played. Moreover, the user can switch to a different maze from within any maze. Lastly, the first maze implements a maze solver that solves the maze independently and then displays the solution without a preset solution.
